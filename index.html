        <p>The Roman Republic was a republic led by the Roman people from 509 B.C. to 27 B.C. It began with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom. At its peak, it stretched from Gaul to Greece. The Republic was in a state of continuous war throughout its existence. Some enemies of the Republic include the Persians, Gauls, Carthaginians, and Etruscans. The vast conquests of the Republic disrupted its society. The immense inrush of slaves also disrupted its society. This enriched the aristocracy but ruined the peasantry and urban workers. To solve this issue, the Populares tried to pass agrarian laws, but the Gracchi brothers and Clodius Pulcher were both murdered by their opponents. These were the Optimates, keepers of the traditional aristocratic order.

            The Roman Republic was preceded by the Roman Kingdom, lead by kings. The seventh king, Tarquin the Proud, was overthrown by Lucius Junius Brutus. This is because the king's son caused a noblewoman to commit suicide. Brutus overthrew the kingdom with the support of the Senate and army. Tarquin was forced to be in exile in Etruria. Brutus was thought of as a hero. The Senate decided to make Rome into a republic.
