        <p>The Roman Republic was a republic led by the Roman people from 509 B.C. to 27 B.C. It began with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom. At its peak, it stretched from Gaul to Greece. The Republic was in a state of continuous war throughout its existence. Some enemies of the Republic include the Persians, Gauls, Carthaginians, and Etruscans. The vast conquests of the Republic disrupted its society. The immense inrush of slaves also disrupted its society. This enriched the aristocracy but ruined the peasantry and urban workers. To solve this issue, the Populares tried to pass agrarian laws, but the Gracchi brothers and Clodius Pulcher were both murdered by their opponents. These were the Optimates, keepers of the traditional aristocratic order.</p>

            The Roman Republic was preceded by the Roman Kingdom, lead by kings. The seventh king, Tarquin the Proud, was overthrown by Lucius Junius Brutus. This is because the king's son caused a noblewoman to commit suicide. Brutus overthrew the kingdom with the support of the Senate and army. Tarquin was forced to be in exile in Etruria. Brutus was thought of as a hero. The Senate decided to make Rome into a republic.

        <p>
            Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus was a Roman general and consul who defeated the great general of Carthage, Hannibal Barca. He is known as one of the most brilliant and strategic commanders of all time. Scipio earned the title of"Africanus" because he defeated Hannibal at Zama, which was near Carthage. Two of his relatives, Scipio Aemilianus and Scipio Asiaticus, were also generals.

            Cato the Elder
        </h3>
        <p>
            Marcus Porcius Cato, also known as Cato the Censor, the Elder and the Wise, was a Roman soldier, senator and historian known for his conservatism and opposition to Hellenization. He was the first to write history in Latin with his Origines, a now lost work on the History of Rome. His work, De agri cultura, a rambling work on agriculture, farming, rituals, and recipes, is the oldest extant prose written in the Latin language. His epithet "Elder" distinguishes him from his equally famous great-grandson Cato the Younger, who opposed Julius Caesar.

            Gaius Marius was a Roman general, politician, and statesman. Victor of the Cimbric and Jugurthine wars, he held the office of consul an unprecedented seven times during his career. He was also noted for his important reforms of Roman armies. He set the precedent for the shift from the militia levies of the middle Republic to the professional soldiery of the late Republic. He also improved the pilum, a javelin, and made large-scale changes to the logistical structure of the Roman army. These reforms were called the Marian reforms.

He had the distinction of holding the office of consul twice, as well as reviving the dictatorship. Sulla was a gifted and innovative general, achieving numerous successes in wars against different opponents, both foreign and domestic. He fought a civil war against Marius and his supporters. He won this civil war. Sulla was awarded dictator for life, but surprisingly resigned after one year. He retired from public life after this.

Following Sulla's assumption of the dictatorship, Crassus amassed an enormous fortune through real estate speculation. Crassus rose to political prominence following his victory over the slave revolt led by Spartacus.

            Pompey
        </h3>
        <p>
            Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus was a leading Roman general and statesman, whose career was significant in Rome's transformation from a republic to empire. He was for a time a political ally and later enemy of Julius Caesar. A member of the senatorial nobility, Pompey entered a military career while still young and rose to prominence serving the later dictator Sulla as a commander in Sulla's civil war, his success at which earned him the cognomen Magnus – "the Great" – after Pompey's boyhood hero Alexander the Great. His adversaries also gave him the nickname adulescentulus carnifex ("teenage butcher") for his ruthlessness.[2] Pompey's success as a general while still young enabled him to advance directly to his first consulship without meeting the normal cursus honorum (required steps in a political career). He was consul three times and celebrated three Roman triumphs.

After Caesar's assassination in 44 BC, Antony joined forces with Lepidus, another of Caesar's generals, and Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, forming a three-man dictatorship known to historians as the Second Triumvirate.

        <p>
            After defeating the Liberators' armies, Octavian and Antony split the republic between them and Lepidus. Octavian got the West and Illyricum. Antony got the Roman East. Lepidus got the African provinces. When Antony met Cleopatra, the ruler of Egypt, he had an affair with her. Antony gave Cleopatra's children territories of the Roman East. Because of this, Octavian declared him an Enemy of the Republic. The Senate declared war against Egypt. At the Battle of Actium, Octavian and his general, Marcus Agrippa, defeated Antony and Cleopatra. Then, they commited suicide. Octavian won the war. Earlier, he had forced Lepidus to give him his territory. Octavian became the ruler of the whole republic. On the 16th of January, 27 BC, the Senate named Octavian "Augustus." This is when modern historians name the beginning of the Roman Empire.
